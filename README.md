Keep Reading, you are up for a wonderful ride....



## Points Of Attraction

### Mobile Responsive
The entire website is mobile responsive. No additional dependency or css frameworks were used to achieve this. Good old fashioned media query and display flex did the trick!

### React JS (Hooks)
Its always good to use latest and newest of the technology. Who uses class based components anyways?

### SASS
This project is awesome, but is our styling also is? Yep! Syntactically awesome style sheet in the houseeee!!!

### Custom Hooks
Lets remove all the redundant code! Using custom hooks i have made sure to re-utilise the same code as much as feasible. (Extra points for that?No? Fine, wait for the next step)

### Live Preview
No one likes to setup an entire project on their local machine. Dont worry buddy, as a fellow engineer, i got you covered! Test the entire application here- https://travel-layout.netlify.app/ . 


(You still have option to clone this repo and run it on your machine)

### Modular Code
The code is made highly modular and i have made sure to follow SRP principle throughout the project. More details about this in the next heading



## Design Principles

## `SRP` - Single Responsibilty Principle
Each component should be responsible for doing only one task. I have made sure to segregate buisness logic from Views. This helps to achieve SRP and code becomes alot more easier to debug

## `DRY` - Dont Repeat Your Self 
I have made sure to make the code more and more reusable. Using custom hooks i have reused the data fetching code for both weather and featured components



And on that note.....+5 points to gryfinddor!! BTW, i was able to complete this enitre work in less than 24 hours...
